    ///        If that didnt work, try searching github for a repo with same name
    ///            if we find a single repo with an exact name, return it
    ///            if we find multiple repos with the exact name, check if all of these are forks
    ///                if they are not forks, check for metrics like activity, code changes, and pick the one which is highest
    ///
    /// also calculate a probability of the repo we found being the right one and return it

    ///     Does not work very well with monorepos
