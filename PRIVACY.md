# Privacy and Telemetry Notice

## Data Collection

The OSS Gadget software itself does *not* collect information about your
use of the software, and therefore does not send such information to any source,
including to Microsoft. Nevertheless, our privacy statement is located at
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. 

However, OSS Gadget does make outbound network connections to various locations,
including NPM (registry.npmjs.org), NuGet (api.nuget.org), and RubyGems (rubygems.org).
These connections are generally unauthenticated and made directly to that service. As such,
their privacy policy would apply.

In addition, the health calculator (oss-health.exe) and metadata (oss-metadata) tools use API keys
to query GitHub and libraries.io. Since this connection is authenticated, the
[GitHub privacy policy](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) and
[Libraries.io privacy policy](https://libraries.io/privacy) would apply.
